## General information
- This is a simple application of "Pong" game. It was written in pure Java with the aid of "Swing" library for drawing graphics.
- The project presents my programming skills how I do write code taking care of several optimisations. I did my best to make code follow the SOLID rules.
- The game consists of deflecting the ball by two paddles placed on opposite sides of the field. Players can move their paddles vertically, and they must not let the ball fly to their side of the screen. If this happens, the opponent receives a point. The game ends when any of the players receives sufficient amount of points.
- Win condition: none
- Lose condition: none

## Used technologies
- "IntelliJIDEA" IDE for writing code
- Eclipse Adoptium 17.0.4.1+1 64-bit
